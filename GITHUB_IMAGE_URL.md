# GitHub Image URL for Netlify

## Your Image URL

Based on your repository, here's the raw GitHub URL for your image:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rugved1817/Happy-wala-Birthdayyyy/main/local/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-08-16%20at%2000.09.18.jpeg
```

## How to Use It

1. **Copy the URL above** (it's already URL-encoded for spaces)

2. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Site settings → Environment variables
   - Find `PIC` variable
   - Edit it
   - Paste the URL above
   - Save

3. **Redeploy**:
   - Go to Deploys tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" → "Clear cache and deploy site"

## Verify the URL Works

Before using it in Netlify, test it:
1. Open this URL in your browser:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rugved1817/Happy-wala-Birthdayyyy/main/local/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-08-16%20at%2000.09.18.jpeg
   ```
2. The image should display directly
3. If it works, use it in Netlify!

## Alternative: Get URL from GitHub UI

If the URL above doesn't work, get it manually:

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Rugved1817/Happy-wala-Birthdayyyy
2. Navigate to: `local/WhatsApp Image 2025-08-16 at 00.09.18.jpeg`
3. Click on the image file
4. Click the **"Raw"** button (top right of the image)
5. Copy the URL from the address bar
6. Use that URL in Netlify's `PIC` variable
